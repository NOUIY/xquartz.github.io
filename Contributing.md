XQuartz is an open source project, and without support from the community, it 
will not be able to flourish.  There are many ways to contribute to the 
project, even for non-programmers or novice programmers.  If any of the tasks 
below look interesting to you, please jump in.

### Mailing Lists ###

If you want to be involved, please join our [mailing lists](Mailing-Lists.html).
This is the best way to communicate with others in the community to offer help
to others or get advice.

### Bug Screening and Triage ###

XQuartz gets a low volume of bug reports, but they can pile up.  It is helpful to
have extra eyes on incoming bug reports and do initial screening to help determine
when regressions were introduced, duplicate bugs when appropriate, or raise the
alarm when a serious issue is discovered.

### Website Design & Content ###

If you're a website designer, and something about this site irritates you, throw
us a bone.

If you see content out of date, you can provide improvements.

This website is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/XQuartz/xquartz.github.io),
so it's easy to fork the site and send pull requests.

Take a look at the [GitHub's Jekyll Documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages)
for setting up jekyll for local testing, and then send us your pull requests.

### Release Management ###

As of XQuartz-2.8.0, we now have a pretty simple build system based on a shell script with some
external dependencies.  All projects that contribute to XQuartz are referenced through git submoodules.

If you'd like to help out with driving updates to XQuartz, join our [mailing lists](Mailing-Lists.html)
and let us know.

### Fixing Bugs ###

If you've got the chops for coding, fix the bugs that irritate you, add features
you're missing, or check out what bugs have been filed by others.  Our
[developer information page](Developer-Info.html) will help you get started.

### Financial ###

All of the software we package are developed through the hard work of the open
source community.  If you would like to make a financial contribution to the
continued efforts of this and related projects, please checkout the
