XQuartz is a collection of many pieces of software that are developed by many
different groups.  As such, bugs may be filed in different bug tracking systems
depending on what component is affected.

### XQuartz and General Screening ###

If in doubt, just file a ticket on Github.  You might be directed elsewhere, but it's a good first step if you aren't sure where to file your issue.

tickets on it have been migrated to gitlab.freedesktop.org.  However, we have
archived the tickets for reference purposes:
